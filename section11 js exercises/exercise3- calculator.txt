// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.
// 2. Stores that first number
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.  


// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!




var first = prompt("enter first number");
var operation = prompt("Which operation? +, -, *, /, or %");
var second = prompt("enter second number");


var sum = Number(first) + Number(second);
var diff = Number(first) - Number(second);
var product = Number(first) * Number(second);
var quotient = Number(first) / Number(second);
var modulus = Number(first) % Number(second);

if (operation === "+"){alert("The sum is " + sum);}
if (operation === "-"){alert("The difference is " + diff);}
if (operation === "*"){alert("The product is " + product);}
if (operation === "/"){alert("The quotient is " + quotient);}
if (operation === "%"){alert("The modulus is " + modulus);}

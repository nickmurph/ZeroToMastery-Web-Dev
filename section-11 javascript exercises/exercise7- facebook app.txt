// Create an object and an array which we will use in our facebook exercise. 

// 1. Create an object that has properties "username" and "password". Fill those values in with strings.
var user = {
	username: "Nick",
	password: "pw123",
};

// 2. Create an array which contains the object you have made above and name the array "database".
var database = [];
database.push(user); //cleaner one line would be-  var database = [user];

// 3. Create an array called "newsfeed" which contains 3 objects with properties "username" and "timeline".
var newsfeed = [
	{
	username: "Steve",
	timeline: "Hey guys",
	},
	{
	username: "Sarah",
	timeline: "newsfeeeeeed",
	},
	{
	username: "Blorg The Epsilon Eridanian",
	timeline: "We are your new overlords",

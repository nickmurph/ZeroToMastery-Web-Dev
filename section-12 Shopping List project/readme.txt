Small project designed to familiarize with the selection and manipulation of elements via the DOM, js, and events.

Went beyond given exercise parameters to add logic for validating/preventing duplicate entries to the list and notifying the user upon the attempted entry of a duplicate item.

Users can add new items to the list, delete any current or added item from the list, and mark items as complete by clicking on the text. Clicking will strike through the text. Simply click again to undo. Click the red X box to delete an item.

May come back later and flesh out the exercise even further:
	- add a layout, center everything, prettify, ensure it's responsive
	- further logic to prevent duplication entries regardless of capitalization (should only be a couple lines)
	- marking items complete via a green checkmark button rather than clicking
	- saving the list as a text file to desktop?
	- sending the list via email?
	- Print button for nicely triggering browser print function of the list, rather than the whole page

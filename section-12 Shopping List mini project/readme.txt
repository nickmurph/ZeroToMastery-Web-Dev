Mini project designed to familiarize one's self with the selection and manipulation of elements via the DOM, js, and events.

Went beyond given exercise parameters to add logic for validating/preventing duplicate entries to the list and notifying the user upon the attempted entry of a duplicate item.

May come back later and flesh out the exercise even further:
	- removal of current items from list (red x button)
	- marking items complete via strikethrough (green x button)
	- saving the list as a text file to desktop?
	- sending the list via email?
